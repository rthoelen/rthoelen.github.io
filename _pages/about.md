I am an HPC/Applications System Architect with over 4 years of supporting High Performance Computing systems for engineering and scientific computing in the aerospace industry. My HPC experience intersects Linux infrastructure support with application support.

Prior to this, I have worked in aerospace developing and maintaining system models and real-time data acquisition systems for testing embedded software in engine control systems. I also worked several years testing embedded control systems for an air cycle machine and running a test lab dedicated to that purpose.

My daily work involves troubleshooting and optimizing HPC workflows for maximum efficiency, working closely with engineering staff. I support a broad mix of COTS and custom HPC codes. My education in software engineering and experience in systems engineering gives me a unique perspective as a system administrator to dig deep into complex problems. I maintain membership in engineering societies to broaden my knowledge and develop my professional network.
